# Core Engineering Concepts

This repository is a **code-first learning and progress-tracking workspace** for core engineering concepts.

It contains reusable code snippets, experiments, and implementations created while learning and exploring different engineering domains. The focus is on writing code, revisiting it later, and connecting concepts across projects — not on formal documentation or polished libraries.

## What this Repository Is

- A place to **push learning code**
- A **centralized workspace** for reusable logic and experiments
- A way to **track learning progress over time**
- A repo to **connect concepts across domains through code**

The code ranges from **basic implementations to intermediate-level explorations**, reflecting the natural learning curve.

## What this Repository Is NOT

- Not a production-ready library
- Not a framework or SDK
- Not a documentation-heavy repository
- Not focused on high-level abstractions

The emphasis is on **understanding through implementation**.

## Repository Structure

- Code is organized by **core concept** or **domain**
- Each folder represents a learning area or engineering topic
- Files may include:
  - Basic implementations
  - Practice code
  - Experimental ideas
  - Reusable snippets for future projects

Structure may evolve as learning progresses.

## Usage

This repository is mainly for:
- Personal learning and experimentation
- Reusing code in future projects
- Revisiting concepts when needed
- Building mental connections between different engineering areas

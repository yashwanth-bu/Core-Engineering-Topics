# Backend – Core Engineering Practice

This folder contains a **code-first learning workspace** focused on **backend engineering** as part of the `Core-Engineering-Topics` repository.

It includes backend implementations and experiments written while learning how systems work behind the scenes — handling logic, data flow, services, and integrations. The emphasis is on practice, experimentation, and reusable backend code rather than production-ready systems.

## Purpose

This folder exists to:

- Learn backend engineering through hands-on coding
- Understand how backend systems are structured and connected
- Practice writing reusable backend logic
- Track learning progress over time
- Build strong foundations for full-stack and system-level development

The focus is on **implementation-driven learning**, not on documentation or polished frameworks.

## What This Folder Contains

- Backend logic and service implementations
- Practice code for core backend concepts
- Experimental and exploratory modules
- Reusable components for other projects
- Code reflecting different stages of the learning curve

## What This Folder Does NOT Aim To Be

- Not a production backend system
- Not a framework or SDK
- Not fully optimized or enterprise-grade
- Not documentation-heavy

This is a **learning-first folder** inside the `Core-Engineering-Topics` repository.

## Structure

- Code is organized by **concept**, **layer**, or **backend area**
- Each subfolder or file represents a specific backend topic or experiment
- Structure may evolve as understanding improves

Files may include:
- Service logic
- Data handling code
- Background tasks or jobs
- Integration experiments
- Configuration and setup experiments

## Usage

This folder is mainly for:
- Learning backend development
- Reusing backend patterns in other parts of this repository
- Revisiting concepts when building full-stack or system-level projects

To explore this folder, clone the main repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yashwanth-bu/Core-Engineering-Topics.git

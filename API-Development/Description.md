# APIs – Core Engineering Practice

This folder contains a **code-first learning workspace** focused on building and understanding **APIs** as part of the larger `Core-Engineering-Topics` repository.

It includes API implementations written while learning backend and system concepts such as request handling, routing, data flow, authentication, validation, and integration patterns. The goal is to learn by building, revisiting code, and reusing patterns in other parts of this repository or future projects.

## Purpose

This folder exists to:

- Practice API development through hands-on coding
- Understand core API concepts by implementation
- Maintain reusable API patterns and logic
- Track learning progress over time
- Build strong backend and system-level fundamentals

The focus is on **learning through implementation**, not on polished or production-ready APIs.

## What This Folder Contains

- Basic to intermediate API implementations
- Experimental endpoints and logic
- Practice code for understanding core API concepts
- Reusable patterns for other projects
- Code reflecting different stages of the learning curve

## What This Folder Does NOT Aim To Be

- Not a production API service
- Not a fully documented API platform
- Not optimized for performance or scale
- Not a framework or library

This is a **learning-first folder** inside the `Core-Engineering-Topics` repository.

## Structure

- Code is organized by **concept**, **feature**, or **practice area**
- Each subfolder or file represents a learning unit or experiment
- Structure may evolve as understanding improves

Examples of what you may find here:
- Simple endpoints
- CRUD implementations
- Authentication experiments
- Integration tests or mock setups

## Usage

This folder is mainly for:
- Learning API design and implementation
- Reusing logic and patterns in other parts of this repository
- Revisiting concepts when building real-world systems

To explore this folder, clone the main repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yashwanth-bu/Core-Engineering-Topics.git

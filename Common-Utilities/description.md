# Common Utilities

This folder contains shared, reusable building blocks that are used across multiple areas of this repository. It represents the foundational logic and supporting concepts that help power implementations in other domains without being tied to any single one.

## Purpose

The goal of **Common Utilities** is to centralize small, focused pieces of logic that naturally appear in different systems and projects. Instead of duplicating these ideas inside domain-specific folders, they live here as reusable components that can be referenced, modified, and revisited over time.

This folder exists to:

* Reduce duplication across learning experiments
* Capture fundamental ideas through code
* Provide reusable building blocks for future implementations
* Help connect concepts across different engineering domains

## What Belongs Here

Code in this folder is:

* **Domain-agnostic**
* **Reusable**
* **Concept-driven**
* **Implementation-focused**

It may include:

* Small utilities or helper functions
* Core logic that supports multiple systems
* Experimental implementations of commonly reused ideas
* Low-level or supporting code used by other folders

## What This Folder Is NOT

* Not a standalone project
* Not production-ready code
* Not a framework or library
* Not documentation-heavy

The emphasis is on learning through implementation rather than polish or completeness.

## Structure

* Code may be organized by idea, pattern, or functionality
* Files and folders can evolve as understanding improves
* Naming and structure are flexible and may change over time

## Usage

This folder is mainly used for:

* Personal learning and experimentation
* Reusing common logic across projects
* Revisiting foundational concepts when needed
* Strengthening connections between different engineering areas

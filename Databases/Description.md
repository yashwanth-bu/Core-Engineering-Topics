# Databases – Core Engineering Practice

This folder contains a **code-first learning workspace** focused on **databases and data management** as part of the `Core-Engineering-Topics` repository.

It includes experiments and practice code for understanding database design, querying, data modeling, and integrations. The emphasis is on **learning through implementation** and building reusable database logic rather than production-ready setups.

## Purpose

This folder exists to:

- Learn core database concepts through hands-on coding
- Practice writing queries, schema design, and data manipulation
- Understand relationships, indexing, and optimization concepts
- Track learning progress over time
- Reuse database patterns in backend or full-stack projects

The focus is on **practical learning**, not on polished or enterprise-level systems.

## What This Folder Contains

- SQL and NoSQL practice code
- Database schema designs and examples
- CRUD operations and query experiments
- Data modeling experiments for different domains
- Reusable database logic and scripts

## What This Folder Does NOT Aim To Be

- Not a production-grade database setup
- Not a full-scale DBMS or platform
- Not fully optimized for performance
- Not documentation-heavy

This is a **learning-first folder** inside the `Core-Engineering-Topics` repository.

## Structure

- Code is organized by **concept**, **database type**, or **practice area**
- Each subfolder or file represents a learning unit or experiment
- Structure may evolve as understanding improves

Files may include:
- SQL queries and scripts
- NoSQL collections and operations
- Sample database designs
- Integration scripts with backend or APIs

## Usage

This folder is mainly for:
- Learning database design and querying
- Practicing data modeling and management
- Reusing database logic in other parts of this repository
- Revisiting database concepts when building full-stack projects

To explore this folder, clone the main repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yashwanth-bu/Core-Engineering-Topics.git
